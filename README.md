## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learn more about responsive design and how to fix the problem about the white space when a image is in a container.
You have two options:

add to container:
```css
.container {
  line-height: 0;
}
```
or to image:

```css
img {
  display: block;
}
```


### Continued development

keep making projects with flexbox and responsive design.
